How to use md5
When you add your users to the database upon registration, 
you should save their passwords as an hashed md5 string. Similarly, 
when they log in, you should hash the input password to make sure it matches with the one saved in the database. 
Here's the idea:

The user being put into your database:


[Sample in saving data]===============================================================


>  import md5 # do this at the top of your file where you import modules



    @app.route('/users/create', methods=['POST'])
    def create_user():
        username = request.form['username']
        email = request.form['email']
   

>     password = md5.new(request.form['password']).hexdigest()

     insert_query = "INSERT INTO users (username, email, password, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (:username,
     :email, :password, NOW(), NOW())"
     query_data = { 'username': username, 'email': email, 'password': password }
     mysql.query_db(insert_query, query_data)

[ When your user is trying to log in:] ===================================================

>   password = md5.new(request.form['password']).hexdigest()
    email = request.form['email']
    user_query = "SELECT * FROM users where users.email = :email AND users.password = :password"
    query_data = { 'email': email, 'password': password}
    user = mysql.query_db(user_query, query_data)
    # do the necessary logic to login if the user exists, otherwise redirect to login page with error message<br>
